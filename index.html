        <h2>...Click a pig to learn more!</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="abbyText" class="Abby content hidden">
        <h2>Abyssinian</h2>
        <p>The Abyssinian is a great choice for first-time owners because of its extremely affectionate personality. Recognize one by spotting eight symmetrical swirls (formally called rosettes), giving it a messy hairdo.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="americanText" class="American content hidden">
        <h2>American</h2>
        <p>As the most common breed, the American Guinea Pig by default wins the popularity contest. They are known for their great temperament and also get along well with other piggies.</p>
    </div> 
    <div id="crestedText" class="Crested content hidden">
        <h2>Crested</h2>
        <p>The white crown atop of its head gave the breed its name. It can be considered the cousin of the American â€” sharing a short, smooth coat. They are shy, but smart creatures. Don't be surprised if yours quickly learns when it's time to eat or even recognizes your voice.</p>
    </div> 
    <div id="himalayanText" class="Himalayan content hidden">
        <h2>Himalayan</h2>
        <p>Himalayans are considered the Siamese cats of the guinea pig world. This albino breed has a white coat with brown or black coloring on its ears, feet, and nose. This breed is recommended for people who live in a colder climate, and away from sun. When a Himalayan is put in direct sunlight or in hot weather, their dark spots fade.</p>
    </div> 
    <div id="merinoText" class="Merino content hidden">
        <h2>Merino</h2>
        <p>Merinos are an intelligent breed who enjoy exploring. It's ideal to provide a large cage and even roaming time around your home. Because of its affectionate nature, it's a popular choice for owners.</p>
    </div> 
    <div id="peruvianText" class="Peruvian content hidden">
        <h2>Peruvian</h2>
        <p>The Peruvian's coat is the envy among all the breeds. The smooth, straight fur can grow as long as 2 feet! The soft, thick fur needs dedicated grooming time and an occasional trim. The coat also grows forward over its head, giving it a sweet fringe. This breed is known to be alert and curious, often greeting visitors who stop by its cage.</p>
    </div> 
    <div id="rexText" class="Rex content hidden">
        <h2>Rex</h2>
        <p>The Rex has short, wool-like fur and is a big hit with children. Its droopy ears are a unique feature that make it look even more lovable. This breed likes to be held close and petted.</p>
    </div> 
    <div id="shebaText" class="Sheba content hidden">
        <h2>Sheba</h2>
        <p>The Sheba, formally known as the Sheba Mini Yak, is affectionally called the "Bad Hair Day" guinea pig. There will always be time for bonding thanks to its dense fur that requires daily maintenance.</p>
    </div> 
    <div id="silkieText" class="Silkie content hidden">
        <h2>Silkie</h2>
        <p>The Silkie (also named the Sheltie) has long locks which only grow backwards. Discovered in the 1970s by breeders in the UK, they are described as being the most gentle breed with laid back personalities. They have extensive grooming needs.</p>
    </div> 
    <div id="skinnyText" class="Skinny content hidden">
        <h2>Skinny</h2>
        <p>The Skinny is part of the hairless guinea pigs, despite having a few furry spots on its back, legs, and feet. It can live for more than four years and it needs another guinea companion to be happy. Although no grooming is necessary, its exposed skin needs a lot of care to avoid wounds or irritations.</p>
    </div> 
    <div id="teddyText" class="Teddy content hidden">
        <h2>Teddy</h2>
        <p>Nicknamed after the famous stuffed animal, the Teddy is an easier breed to keep up with. Its short, dense coat only needs a brushing once in a while. This breed make a playful, loving partner for children. Being social with other piggies is in their DNA, but you may need to watch how they react to sharing a cage. </p>
    </div> 
    <div id="texelText" class="Texel content hidden">
        <h2>Texel</h2>
        <p>Texels are a rare cross breed between a Silkie and a Rex. Tangling will happen with their fur, and it can be difficult to take care of. They are known for winning first place at shows, but they make great pets as well.</p>
